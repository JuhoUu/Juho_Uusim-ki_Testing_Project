> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?

It was difficult to understand at first, but once i got the hang of it, it was actually quite easy.

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.

I followed the instructions and templates.

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 
 I have heard a lot about Jira so probably that.


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?

I used Visual Studio Code, because I have used it on many other courses so its pretty familiar to use.


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?

At first it was hard to start writing the test cases because I wasnt thinking the right way. But eventually I Understood what i needed to do.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?

No trouble using Github, i have used it many times on other courses, such as Javascript and Full Stack.
 

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )

The only one i have heard more than once is Robot Framework, so probably that one. I have heard that its pretty easy to use.



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing

-preferably experience on testing
-relevant It-education
-Skills on Test automation and DevOps tools (Robot Framework,Jenkins, Ansible)
-wanting to improve your skills in the future



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?

I havent used Robot Framework or any other testing tool and I dont have any experience in DevOps tools so i need to get experience on those.




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 

Project was maybe a little unclear, i think in the future you should go a bit deeper into it with the students at the start of the project. I think the theory part was very wide and this practical part was kinda short. In the future, maybe little less theory and more of the practical side could be nice.
